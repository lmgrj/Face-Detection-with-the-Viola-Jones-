Face Detection with the Viola-Jones Object Detection Framework 
Viola-Jones Object Detection Framework can quickly and accurately detect objects in images and works particularly well with the human face (Viola & Jones, 2001). Despite its age, the framework is still a leading player in face detection along side many of its CNNs counter parts. The Viola-Jones Object Detection Framework combines the concepts of <b>Haar-like</b> Features, Integral Images, the AdaBoost Algorithm, and the Cascade Classifier to create a system for object detection that is fast and accurate. 
<h2>An article about haar-like features extraction will be created soon in my website.</h2>
